## 1. Overview
In many regions, unreliable internet connectivity limits the adoption of digital transactions. Simultaneously, a lack of financial literacy prevents individuals from making informed money management decisions. Our solution bridges these gaps by combining a secure offline payment mechanism via QR codes on an Android app with a comprehensive web-based financial literacy and budgeting platform. This dual approach promotes financial inclusion and ensures reliable transactions in low-connectivity scenarios.

## 2. Problem Statement

- Enabling secure, offline transactions using QR codes and virtual tokens.
- Integrating financial literacy tools, educational content, and an automated budgeting system.

## 3. Problem Analysis
- **Connectivity Issues:** Traditional digital payment methods fail in poor internet conditions, affecting remote communities and small-scale vendors.

  - Transactions are recorded as virtual tokens and synced when internet connectivity is restored.
- **Security:**
  - End-to-end encryption ensures transaction security.
- **Intermediate Bank Integration:**
  - Upon reconnection, transactions are validated and virtual tokens are converted into real money.

#### B. **Web App – Financial Literacy, Budgeting, and Transaction Management**
